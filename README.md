# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms and Applications

This repository is dedicated to showcasing various algorithms and utilities used in the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). 

## Overview

Reinforcement learning, a pivotal branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on how agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. This repository contains implementations of several RL algorithms, demonstrating their applications.

## Contents

The repository is organized into three main folders, each containing a unique RL application:

1. **Self-Driving Car**
   - Utilizes a simple Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to power a self-driving car simulation.

2. **Doomviz**
   - Employs a Dueling Network Architecture for playing the classic old-school game "Doom". This approach showcases the advanced capabilities of RL in decision-making scenarios.

3. **Breakout**
   - Implements the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm for playing the classic Atari game "Breakout". This demonstrates the use of parallel computing in RL. 
   - The underlying framework is Gymnasium, a recently deprecated version of OpenAI's Gym library. Gymnasium is used to simulate game environments, providing a robust platform for RL applications and research.

## Technologies

- **Gymnasium**: A continuation and expansion of OpenAI's Gym, providing a variety of simulated environments for developing and benchmarking RL algorithms.

## Getting Started

To explore these algorithms:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired project folder.
3. Follow the individual instructions in each folder to set up and run the simulations.
